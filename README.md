# icera1n
Version 2.0: Sail Riot

User-friendly wrapper for palera1n, futurerestore and entering pwndfu mode.
Works on linux (tested on arch btw). This should work on mac.

This tool automatically installs palera1n and provides you with a
menu to jailbreak your palera1n compatible device.

Note for Linux users: Install usbmuxd with your package manager if not installed. Manually stop usbmuxd if your linux distro does not have systemd / systemctl. You do not have to start usbmuxd as the script takes care
