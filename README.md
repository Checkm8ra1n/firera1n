## What is icera1n?

Icera1n is a wrapper for palera1n, futurerestore, checkm8-nonce-setter, gaster, and backing up and restoring activation files from your iDevice.

## What can it do for you?

It can help you jailbreak, down / upgrade using futurerestore, and backup and restore activation files from your iDevice.

## Backing up and restoring activation files? What's that for ???

Backing up and restoring activation files is necessary when you downgrade a device using iOS 16 / 17 SEP or in simple terms when you downgrade a device which supports iOS 16 / 17 to iOS 15. If you don't backup and restore your activation files you will be stuck in setup after you finish the restore.

## ( Coming Soon)

 - Guide on backing up and restoring activatin files already exists but I did not test it yet so don't do it.
 - Bypassing iCloud lock
