# icera1n
Version 2.0: Sail Riot

User-friendly wrapper for palera1n, futurerestore and entering pwndfu mode.
Works on linux (tested on arch btw). This should work on mac.

This tool automatically installs palera1n and provides you with a
menu to jailbreak your palera1n compatible device. It also comes
with futurerestore and tools to enter PwnDFU mode.

It makes it easy to do these things with an easily navigatable menu:

Jailbreak iPhone with Palera1n
Enter PwnDFU mode
Use Futurerestore

Why use this for futurerestore?

The futurerestore gui has became a little... Janky, and it is quite difficult for beginners to deal with gaster and pwndfu mode. This simplifies it.

Why use this for palera1n?

It needs less command line knowledge and makes it more easy to understand for new users.


Note for Linux users: Install usbmuxd with your package manager if not installed. Manually stop usbmuxd if your linux distro does not have systemd / systemctl. You do not have to start usbmuxd as the script takes care
