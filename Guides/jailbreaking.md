Disclaimer:

On A11 devices, you must disable your passcode and will not be able to use your passcode, or other SEP functionality, until you boot into a stock iOS state. SEP functionality includes things such as a passcode, Face ID/Touch ID, and Apple Pay.

Additionally, if your device is an A11 device on iOS 16 and you've set a passcode before, you will need to erase all content and settings in order to be able to jailbreak.

This jailbreak only supports devices on iOS 15, 16 and 17 which have an A11 chip or lower
